Kodiak is free for personal use and public repositories, but requires a subscription for use with private GitHub Organization repositories.

A Kodiak subscription is billed at \$4.99 per active user per month. An active user is anyone that opens a private GitHub pull request that Kodiak updates, approves, or merges.

Kodiak has a 30 day free trial that can be activated on [the dashboard](https://app.kodiakhq.com).
